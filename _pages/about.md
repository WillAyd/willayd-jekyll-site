I have worked in data and analytics for over 15 years. Over that time I have seen tools come and go, skills trend up and down, and companies drastically shift the way they value data.

Through my consulting company [innobi](https://innobi.io/) I have had the pleasure to help quite a few clients navigate the ever-changing analytics landscape, with the ultimately goal of making data *easy*. 10 of my 15 years have been spent working in the Apparel and Footwear workspace, but I have also consulted for companies in the fields of consumer electronics, pharmaceutical drug discovery, finance, online advertising, and even marketing.

While every company is different, many of the same problematic patterns reoccur, often as a result of over-engineering. Perhaps not surprisingly my favorite excerpt from the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) goes:

> Explicit is better than implicit.<br/>
>  Simple is better than complex.<br/>
>  Complex is better than complicated.

I *really* love consulting and working with data. What some may consider a job, I consider a passion. Words cannot express enough how grateful I am for this.

Outside of my day job I love to program, tinker and learn. I am a core maintainer of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), creator of [pantab](https://pantab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and contributor to various open source projects in data/analytics space.

I have also been privileged to speak at various conferences. Here are a few talks you may find interesting:
